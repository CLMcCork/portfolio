        <h3>October 26, 2020</h3>

        <p>Hi there! It's hard to believe it's almost the end of October, class is just moving right along.</p>

        <P>During week 6 of Skilled KC, we worked together on a group project (teams of 3). Each person on the team was given a specific role, Project Manager,
          Senior Developer, and UI/Ux Designer with specific responsibilities. This was the first time we have collaborated and used Github together. My role was the Senior Developer and I definitely learned
          about creating the correct file strucutre (I originally put my files in the wrong place and had to restructure everything--yikes!) and how to merge in Pull Requests. My team 
          created a website for a company called, Pizza Planet (from Toy Story). It was fun working together and talking about 
          our ideas. Each team was pretty much in charge of how they were going to work together, what time they would meet/check in with each other,
          setting deadlines, updating progress on our Kanban board, and working together to push out our code. I think the biggest things I've learned from this group experience 
          are how to work together as a team, communicating (it's better to overcommunicate!), and making sure I'm asking the right questions. I'm definitely looking forward to doing more group projects and 
          working on those super important teamwork skills.
        </P>

        <p>Last week, week 7 of Skilled KC, we started learning JavaScript. YAY! I was so pumped to be starting this unit! This week, week 8 of class, we are still working on JS. We just 
          finished our first lab (a temperature converter that uses JS). Tomorrow we are starting our next lab, Fizzbuzz. I'm excited/nervous--I can definitely feel the pace of the class has 
          picked up and I want to make sure I'm keeping up. With that being said, I'm off to code some more--I can't think of a better way to spend a snowy October evening. :) 
        </p>
        <h3>October 9, 2020</h3>

        <p>Today wrapped up week 5 of classes! How is that even possible?! Time has serisouly flown by and I've already learned so much.
          I am so thankful to the Kauffman Foundation for providing everyone in our program free tuition to Skilled KC. This is such
          an amazing, life changing opportunity and I have to keep pinching myself to make sure I'm not dreaming. The staff and instructors 
          at Skilled KC have been amazing and defintely have the students' best interests at heart. The instructors are top notch indsutry 
          experts who are patient, always available for questions, and who truly desire success for all of the students in the program.
          The instructors truly care and will go to great lengths to help all of us become great developers.
          I feel like there are just not enough words to say to how thankful I am for this program. So, thanks Skilled KC!</p>

        <p>These past 5 weeks have been a whirlwind of information. This is a brief overview of what we learned, I'm sure I probably missed something.
          We started the course with a high level view of everything we will learn. We learned about how the internet works, the software development life cycle (SDLC), the Agile method, Kanban boards, different roles 
          in the technology field, different programming langauges, frameworks, and libraries, operators, data types, branching and looping, data 
          structures, and git. 
        </p>

        <p>After this intense, high level overview, we dove right into setting up our developer environment by downloading 
          software via the terminal. We then started learning about HTML and CSS. We also learned about the web design process as well as UI/UX design. 
          We implemented Trello boards to keep track of our to do lists (we will use them as Kanban boards when we work on our teams). We then created 
          an About Me page using just HTML and CSS to look exactly like a document we were given.</p>
        
        <p>Next up, we learned about Bootstrap and how to implement it into our code to allow for responsive design. We discussed how to use Github and 
          created repos. We then were given an assignment to create our portfolio website. We were asked to create a requirements document with user personas 
          and user stories, sitemaps, wireframes, analyze risks, and come up with features for future iterations. 
        </p>

        <p>I love how Bootstrap templates can allow your page to be responsive and beautiful right out of the gate. I also like that you can still
          change the template and customize it to reflect your personality. I am not a graphic designer, so a Bootstrap template is the perfect option for 
          me right now as I'm getting my feet wet in the coding world. 
        </p>

        <p>Alight, well that pretty much sums up these last 5 weeks. Like I said, I've learned so much and I'm just so excited to continue on this journey.
          I have so much to learn and I'm excited to keep going!</p>

        

        <h3>October 8, 2020</h3>

        <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by and checking out my blog. I'm writing this blog to document my learning journey
          as I progress through Skilled KC's full-stack software developer program. I want to use this blog to not only reflect on 
          what I am learning about in class, but also to be able to see how far I have come once I am finished with the program.</p>
          
        <p>This post is going to be a little unusual and much longer than normal because I want to catch you up on my learning journey 
          so far. So, grab some coffee and settle in--I'll try to not be too wordy, but no promises. :)</p>
          
        <p>I would say my coding journey offically began the summer of 2013. My Mom, who had owned a dance studio my entire life, had closed  
          her business several years prior to 2013. I grew up dancing and teaching dance and thoroughly missed it. My Mom and I starting chatting 
          about this one day and realized that we both wanted to teach dance again. We decided to go into business together as partners, a mother-daughter 
          team.</p>

        <p>Times had changed since my Mom had the dance studio business before. I knew right away that we needed a website to promote our new 
            business. I did a little googling and found out that to make a website I would just need to slap together some HTML and CSS. Easy, right? 
            I'm a go-getter and decided that to save money, I would build our website from scratch myself. So, I ordered a HTML and CSS book off of Amazon and created 
            a beautiful, responsive website in an hour.</p>

        <p>Ha! I wish! Actually, the real story is I started reading the books and realized I was way in over my head. We needed to get our website 
            done as soon as possible and I knew that I was not the girl for the job. Thankfully, my cousin is a web developer and he graciously 
            created our website for us in record timing. So, we were all set.</p>

        <p>I was amazed at my cousin's website creation. He was able to create a beautiful, fully responsive website in just a few days. I felt like
              it was magic. Ever since then I have been smitten with code.</p>

        <p>Ever since my cousin created our website for us, I have been drawn to code. However, I've mostly just dabbled and played around. I worked 
          through some exercises on Free Code Camp and bought some different classes online that promised to teach me to code. However, I found it so hard
          to fit coding into my already busy schedule and had trouble keeping up my coding habit.</p>

        <p>In 2019, after dabbling with code for so long, I decided that I needed to stop talking about how much I wanted to be in tech and to just go after it. I quit my job working at a local 
          school and started looking for a job at a tech company. I was offered a position at an amazing tech company here in Kansas City as a Technical Support
          Operations Specialist. Everything about this company was amazing--the people, the customers, everything. The job itself also taught me a lot. I had 
          no tech experience prior to this role, so everything was new. My role was on the Customer Success (CS) team, however my main responsibility was 
          building and updating apps to the Apple and Google Play stores. I learned about creating certificates, how to troubleshoot the build server, 
          working with customers through Zendesk, how to create bug tickets in Jira, and how to document my whole process in Confluence. So many new tools
          and things to learn! It was so exciting! (I'm a nerd and absolutely LOVE to learn!)</p>

        <p>In our office I was able to hear our engineering team during their daily stand ups. I was always listening with one ear, trying to see if I could
          learn anything new. I was constantly amazed by our engineering team. They made ideas come to life, squashed bugs, and were just all around wonderful, smart
          people. I wanted to be one of them.</p>

        <P>I knew I wanted to be a developer, the question was how? I had tried coding after work and usually couldn't muster the energy to cook, work out and code. 
          I tried getting up earlier and coding then, however it usually just made me super tired for the rest of the day. I wasn't sure how I was going to make my
          dream of becoming a developer a reality.</P>
        
        <p>I started looking into coding bootcamps. This seemed like the way to go for me. I wanted to go all in and prioritize coding in my life. I wanted to be in a class setting where I could have an experienced instructor
          who could help with any questions. However, most of these bootcamps are so expensive. My husband and I are huge fans of Dave Ramsey and I was not willing
          to go into debt or sign an ISA in order to attend a bootcamp.</p>

        <p>It was during my research into bootcamps that I stumbled upon Skilled KC's program. It sounded too good to be true! How could a program like this be free? I requested
          more information, not thinking that this would end up being a legitamate course. However, after speaking with Skilled KC I realized that this course was indeed free.
          We would even receive MacBook Pros, career help, all along with the free instruction that would allow me to become a developer. I knew that this was the right 
          program for me! 
        </p>

        <p>I loved the company and the people I worked with at my job, however Skilled KC's software developer program was an opportunity I just could not pass up. I prayed about it,
          spoke with my husband and family, and made the decision to put my notice in at my current job and go all in.</p>
        
        <p>So far, I've learned so much and couldn't be happier with my decision. I'm so excited to see where this program leads me to down the road. Great things are 
          happening and it's all thanks to Skilled KC. (And no, they did not pay or ask me to say that!)
